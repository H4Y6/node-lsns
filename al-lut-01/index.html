      The SR-7,1vas developed as a black project frorn the Lockheed A-12
      reconnaissance aircraft during the 1960s by Lockheed's Skunk Works
      division. Arnerican aerospace engineer Clarence "Kelly" Johnson was
      responsible for rnany of the aircraft's innovative concepts. The shape of
      the SR-71 ,vas based on that of the A-12, ,vhich ,vas one of the first
      aircraft to be designed ,vith a reduced radar cross-section. At one point,
      a bomber variant of the aircraft ,vas under consideration, before the
      progran1 ,vas focused solely on reconnaissance. Mission equipment for the
      reconnaissance role included signals intelligence sensors, a side-looking
      airborne radar, and a photo camera; the SR-71 ,vas both longer and heavier
      than the A-12, allo,ving it hold more fuel as well as a tvvo-seat cockpit.
      The SR-71 designation has been attributed to lobbying efforts by USAF
      Chief of Staff General Curtis LeMay, who preferred the SR (Strategic
      Reconnaissance) designation over sin1ply RS (Reconnaissance). The aircraft
      was introduced to operational service in January 1966.
